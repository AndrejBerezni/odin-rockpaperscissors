# odin-rockpaperscissors

This little project was created as part of **THE ODIN PROJECT** curriculum, while following ""Full-Stack JavaScript path**.

For now, goal of this project was to create Rock-Paper-Scissors, using only JS - later in curriculum I will come back to it to make it a browser game.

You play it by executing function **game()** in the console.

It will prompt you to enter your choice: rock, paper or scissors. If you enter anything else, it will count as you entered 'scissors'.

Game is played until player or computer wins 3 rounds.
